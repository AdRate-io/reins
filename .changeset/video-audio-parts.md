Video and audio content parts.

- core: `ContentPart` gains `VideoPart` (`type: "video"`) and `AudioPart` (`type: "audio"`): `mime` must start with `video/` / `audio/`, base64 `data`, optional `durationSec` (finite, positive). `LoweringCapabilities` gains optional `video` / `audio`; absent means the model does not take them. Token estimates follow duration (100 / s for video, 32 / s for audio); without `durationSec` the byte size is converted at 1 Mbps / 64 kbps with a 30-second floor. `isContentPart` checks the new parts and is now also what `runLoop` uses to validate input — which also means `runLoop` input now rejects a `tool_reference` part whose `inputSchema` is an array (tool results already did). A tool returning an array of video / audio-shaped parts now yields media parts instead of JSON text. The budget-truncation summary writes `[video]` / `[audio]` / `[tool <name>]` instead of `[image]` for non-image parts. No `schemaVersion` bump: existing logs read unchanged, but a log containing video or audio parts cannot be read by an older version.
- lowering-fetch: new `video` / `audio` model options (default `false`, including every built-in model). When on, video and audio travel in each protocol's image slot — a relay dialect official endpoints reject; `input_audio` is deliberately not used. When off, they become placeholder text and the event is `lossy`. Chat lifts video / audio from tool results like images; a result with images only lowers byte-for-byte as before. Fix: `deepseek-v4-pro` is text-only (`images: false`) — the built-in table and `deepseek()` used to claim images, which the provider silently dropped.
- lowering-pi: video / audio parts become placeholder text (`lossy`); pi-ai has no such content.
- server: the HTTP whitelist accepts `video` / `audio` parts with the same shape rules as core.
- adapter-tanstack-ai: data-sourced video / audio parts translate both ways (TanStack has no duration field). URL-sourced parts are now reported in `dropped` as `audio(url)` / `video(url)` instead of `audio` / `video`, and data parts whose mime type does not match their kind as `video(<mime>)` / `audio(<mime>)`. Imported client parts are now checked with core's `isContentPart`: a malformed one (missing `mimeType`, non-string `value`, non-string text) becomes a placeholder reported in `dropped` instead of throwing or reaching the log.
- ui-agui: video / audio parts become `[video <mime>]` / `[audio <mime>]` placeholders, recorded in `dropped`.
- tools-mcp: MCP `audio` blocks and `video/*` / `audio/*` embedded resources become audio / video parts instead of descriptions.
