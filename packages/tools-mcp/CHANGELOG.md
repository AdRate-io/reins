# @reinsjs/tools-mcp

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First public release.

  - **Timeline first.** Append-only event log with `schemaVersion` on every event and fail-closed upcast on read; projection decides what the model sees each turn; replay and fork from the log alone.
  - **A loop you can copy.** `runLoop` as an exported async generator: pause/resume is a return value with a small signed state, bounded retry on transient failures only while nothing has been written, tool pipeline `beforeTool → validate → approval → execute → afterTool`, sub-agent pause bubbling (`Interruption { kind: "subagent" }`).
  - **Brain modules** (`@reinsjs/brain`): perception, compact (with folded-result manifest and `recall`; recommended on after measuring 100% recall at lower token cost on two model families), pins, spill, handoff, memory (`memory_20250818` shape, namespace isolation), approval (deny → ask → allow, fail-closed), budget (five limits, sub-agent usage included).
  - **Lowering** (`@reinsjs/lowering-pi`): Anthropic Messages and OpenAI Responses via pi-ai with a declared loss matrix, trust markers on untrusted content, cache-breakpoint handling.
  - **Serving** (`@reinsjs/server`, `@reinsjs/ui-agui`): Web-standard handler with SSE replay from `lastSeq`, per-session run lock, `authorizeSession` (only `true` allows), AG-UI as the first-class UI protocol.
  - **Stores**: SQLite (`node:sqlite` / `bun:sqlite`) and Postgres (`pg` / PGlite), conformance-tested; configurable memory table for per-role isolation.
  - **Tools**: MCP servers as one socket (`@reinsjs/tools-mcp`, tools bound per run, annotations as defaults not permissions); `asTool(agent)` in `reins`.
  - **TanStack AI** middleware (`@reinsjs/adapter-tanstack-ai`): the brain on TanStack's loop with the log as the single source of truth; idempotent client-message import; runtime check for the approval interrupt.
  - **Eval harness** (`@reinsjs/eval`): fixtures from real recordings, recorded tools, arm-vs-arm runner, metrics, the four-rule gate.
